===============

XBMC Service and Addon Wrapper for included files (slightly modified) pyftpdlib ( available @ http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/ ).  This is basically meant to be run a FTPD Server as a service within XBMC via Python, without the need of using other languages, so to be usable on more platforms.  I wanted to study how to do service projects for XBMC and so this project came about to study and learn how.
