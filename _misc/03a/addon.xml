  	<description>This is basically a service project to handle the running of a nice FTP Server I found code for, as noted in the changelog.txt.  This is ment to eventually be for quick and easy use of even semi-newb-users, but for now is mainly meant for Advanced Users, until things get weeded out and more people come to understand how it works.  Some things May be a bit tempormental, but if all else fails, uncheck Enable Server and Restart XBMC.</description>
  	<disclaimer lang="en">This Project is designed for xbmc v13.x originally and currently being kept up on one of the nightly xbmcc v13.x builds. It gets a slight bit of testing as I use it myself, a LOT, on a Windows 7 OS. Any other OS's / builds of xbmc have not be tested on yet, but I do feel free to try and test it out on them. Some parts of this addon may not be legal in your country of residence - please check with your local laws before installing. I take no responsibility for any problems this plugin might in any way, form, shape or size cause. This is project is for a LEARNING EXPERIANCE.</disclaimer>
